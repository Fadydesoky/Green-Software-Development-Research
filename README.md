Abstract
This research investigates the energy consumption patterns of software systems by analyzing application resource usage, including CPU operations, system memory, and I/O operations, to identify factors contributing to energy inefficiency. 
A predictive model, employing data analytics and machine learning algorithms, was developed to forecast software energy use based on identified resource usage patterns. 
The model demonstrated a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 33.12 KWh and an R-squared (R²) value of 0.672, indicating its capability to predict energy consumption with reasonable accuracy. 
Key findings highlight the significant influence of CPU and GPU energy consumption, memory usage, “Current (A)”, and “Voltage (V)” on overall energy consumption. 
The practical implications of this work include informing strategies for code optimization, resource handling, and runtime modifications to reduce software energy drain. 
Furthermore, the research contributes to sustainable software development by providing insights for creating more energy-efficient applications. 
Future work could explore advanced modeling techniques and incorporate additional environmental and workload factors to enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability.
